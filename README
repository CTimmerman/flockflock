FlockFlock - file access policy enforcement
by Jonathan Zdziarski 

THE PROBLEM
One of the worst parts about being compromised is not knowing you're 
compromised, and having your data stolen by spyware, or hijacked by
ransomware, only to find out about it too late. Most security researchers 
aren't even 100% positive that their system hasn't been compromised. 
Between spyware, ransomware, government hacking, and other threats, simply
relying on file permissions and a secure execution environment on longer
cuts it. There's a much needed solution for a tool that can keep your
personal data protected from potentially malicious software that has
rotted your system.

WHAT IS FLOCKFLOCK?

In Simple Terms:

FlockFlock is a utility to help protect your personal files in OS X,
to be able to tell if your system has been compromised, and to defend
your personal data against randsomware, spyware, infection, and other 
threats by preventing unauthorized processes (even by super user processes)
from being able to open and read your files without your explicit 
permission.

In short, FlockFlock is like the popular "Little Snitch" program, but for
file access instead of network connections. It integrates with the
operating system on a low level, and has capabilities higher than root.

For Developers:

FlockFlock is a programmable OS X kernel extension that enforces file access
policy using OS X's kernel-level MAC (mandatory access control) framework.
The MAC framework began in TrustedBSD and was later adopted into the
Darwin kernel; it allows FlockFlock to intercept every file open call on
the system and analyze it against a set of rules programmed into the kernel
at login time. Even if an attacker gets root on your system and kills off
the helper daemon, the kernel module will continue to enforce the user's
rules (and also attempt to defend FlockFlock from being unloaded or
deleted).

FlockFlock comes in two pieces: the kernel extension, which contains a live
copy of all active rules (so that a rooted device should not be able to
disable it), and a user space client, which runs when the user logs in to
program the kernel module, prompt the user for unauthorized file access
attempts, and add new rules to the user's ~/.flockflockrc file.

FlockFlock is also open source, because there is such a lack of good
driver and kernel code for Mac. I think you'll find FlockFlock to be
very useful in developing your own kernel-mode drivers. FlockFlock is an
IOKit based driver, and the source code should help you understand
complex concepts such as mach messages, user-space client communication,
driver contruction, memory and locking, and much more. Enjoy the knowledge!

WHY THE STUPID NAME?

It's a play on words with the old unix "flock" style advisory locking
combined with a hat tip to Patrick Wardle, author of BlockBlock, which
is a different type of system integrity protection tool you should also
be using.

NOTE: FlockFlock's locking is much more advanced than the flocks of olde,
    it's just a play on words, and does not rely on (or use) flocks.

FEATURES

- Real-time, kernel-level protection against unauthorized access to files
- Defend against randomware, spyware or other malicious programs that
  might attempt to steal or encrypt your personal
- A user-friendly interface to add new rules and receive notifications of
  unauthorized access attempts.
- Self-defending; must be uninstalled from recovery mode. Protects
  against root processes from unloading the kernel extension or
  deleting or moving any core files.

INSTALLATION

Until Apple provides me with kext a kext signing certificate, you will
have to /temporarily/ disable SIP in order to install or uninstall 
FlockFlock. Once installed, you can immediately turn it back on.

1. Reboot your computer into "Recovery Mode" by rebooting and holding in
   Command-R after the chime, until it boots to the recovery partition.
   Start a Terminal (Utilities->Terminal) and type:

	csrutil disable; reboot

2. When your system reboots, double click the FlockFlock.pkg file and 
   follow the installation process.

3. After installation is complete, reboot back into recovery mode to
   re-enable SIP, by typing: csruril enable; reboot

FIRST USE

When the system comes back up, FlockFlock should be active on your
system, and you should start being prompted to grant file access
permissions to various programs you might run.

When first running your favorite applications for the first time,
you'll be prompted to allow or deny access to specific files or folders.
This allows you to set up initial access rules. FlockFlock will remember
your choices so it won't bother you again, unless you check the box
"Forget after Restart".

RULES EDITING

To help make FlockFlock robust against attacks, rules editing is not
currently possible except from recovery mode.

1. Boot into recovery mode
2. Open a terminal
3. You may either edit or delete the .flockflockrc file in your home
   directory. If you delete it, it will be replaced with the defaults.c
4. Reboot back into the OS

REMOVAL / IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

In the event you don't like FlockFlock, or something has tampered with it, 
causing issues with your system, you can remove it only one way:

To delete FlockFlock, you'll also need to boot into recovery mode. This
is because FlockFlock defends itself against deletion or other attempts
to remove it. Launch a terminal in recovery mode, then run the following
commands:

NOTE: "Macintosh HD" may be mounted somewhere else on your system

cd "/Volumes/Machintosh HD"
rm -rf ./Library/Extensions/FlockFlock.kext
rm -rf ./Library/Application\ Support/FlockFlock
rm -f ./Library/LaunchDaemons/com.zdziarski.FlockFlock.plist
rm -f ./Users/<your username>/Library/LaunchAgents/com.zdziarski.FlockFlockUserAgent.plist
rm -f ./Users/<your username>/.flockflockrc
reboot

When the system comes back up, FlockFlock should be gone.

SELF DEFENSE

The module prevents deletion of core files. Any attempt to unload the
kernel extension, except through recovery mode, will cause a kernel
panic and subsequent reboot. These are designed to protect your data,
not make things convenient.

COMPATIBILITY

- Requires a minimum of OS X El Capitan

  NOTE: THIS SOFTWARE IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND MAY HAVE SEVERE BUGS

KNOWN BUGS

- None (this list is expected to grow)

FUTURE PLANS
- Implement a rules editing tool in user-space and give it exclusive
  editing capabilities (to avoid having to boot into recovery mode)
- Implement temporary rules that expire when the process exits
- Implement one-time access (in addition to "Forget on Restart")
- Implement activity logging
- Richer popup screen to support more configurations

FAQ

- What does this protect?
  The default ruleset protects files in /Users only, although this can
  be changed. If FlockFlock tried to block on every file acccess in the
  system, everything would come to a screeching halt. 

- Does this impact performance?
  When an application attempts to access a protected file, FlockFlock
  performs a policy lookup. The lookup is generally fast, and should not
  impact performance except possibly on extremely busy systems that are
  opening a lot of files in the background.

- Where performance is impacted is the quarantine during a user prompt.
  If FlockFlock decides the user must approve the file access, then the
  program is blocked on the file access until the user responds. This, 
  obviously, is the behavior you want, but if you let the prompt sit there
  forever, you'll end up getting a backlog of prompts to answer, which can
  become a bottleneck for you. It could possibly also make some programs
  malfunction, such as those that are waiting for a file to open and let
  a network connection time out due to being blocked.
